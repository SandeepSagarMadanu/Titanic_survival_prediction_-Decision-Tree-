# Titanic Survival Prediction

This beginner-friendly machine learning project predicts passenger survival on the Titanic using key features such as class, sex, age, and fare. It uses a Decision Tree Classifier and is based on the classic [Kaggle Titanic competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/overview).

## 🧾 Files

- `main.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and results.
- `gender_submission.csv`: Sample submission CSV format from Kaggle.

## 📊 Features Used

- `Pclass` - Ticket class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
- `Sex` - Gender of the passenger
- `Age` - Age in years
- `Fare` - Fare paid for the ticket

## 🧠 Model

- **Type:** Decision Tree Classifier
- **Libraries Used:** `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `LabelEncoder`

## ✅ Performance

- **Accuracy Achieved:** ~100.00% *(on a small sample/simulated dataset)*

> ⚠️ Note: This accuracy is based on a simulated and very small sample dataset. For realistic performance, train the model on the full Titanic dataset (`train.csv` from Kaggle).

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/titanic-survival-prediction.git
   cd titanic-survival-prediction
